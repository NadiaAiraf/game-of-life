## Game of Life (Aidan's)

This project is a small spiked project containing my first foray into using React. It's basically a continuation of the React tic tac toe tutorial that can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) using the same CSS and manipulating it to create something similar to the game of life.

The keen eyed observer might notice it's not exactly the game of life. I have a proper working code for the game of life on codewars but for the purposes of learning React I simplified things slightly as you might be able to tell.

### How to Run

1. clone this repo
2. `npm start`
3. visit localhost:3000

It should be that simple, if you have any issues a likely problem is due to not using the right version of npm.

### Pretty colours
